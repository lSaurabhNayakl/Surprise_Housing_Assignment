## General Information
- Background: Surprise Housing, a US-based company, aims to enter the Australian market by purchasing houses below market value and selling them at a profit. They've collected a dataset of Australian house sales for analysis.
- Business Problem: The company seeks to determine which variables significantly influence house prices and how well these variables explain price variations.
- Dataset: The dataset for this analysis is provided in the accompanying CSV file named "train.csv".

## Conclusions
- Significant Variables: Through the regression analysis, it was found that variables such as GrLivArea(Larger above-ground living area), OverallQual, OverallQual, TotalBsmtSF(total basement area), and GarageArea(garage size) significantly influence house prices.
- Model Performance: The regression model demonstrated strong predictive power in estimating house prices based on the selected variables, with a high degree of accuracy.
- Optimal Regularization: The optimal values of lambda for ridge and lasso regression were determined through cross-validation, ensuring the most effective regularization for the model.
